# Project 1

## Overview

Wild Pokémon have invaded a nearby city, and all Pokédexes are malfunctioning. You are tasked with producing a model that can help Pokémon trainers identify each Pokémon type. This model will be invaluable in fighting and capturing the wild Pokémon.

In your first challenge, you will train Deep Learning models to perform image classification. The classes are the main types of the Pokémon that were sighted inside city buildings.

## Description

The datasets are divided into train and test. There is a dataloader that can be helpful for the task.

In this assignment, you will need to complete the following tasks:

- Create an MLP architecture to learn the main type of Pokemon in each image (Multiclass classification). Train the model and evaluate it. Explain how you discovered the best architecture and what regularization, optimizers, etc you used.
- Create a CNN architecture for the same purpose, train it, and evaluate it. Compare the MLP's performance and capacity.
- Use pre-trained models for transfer learning and fine-tuning for this task.
- Try data augmentation techniques, and regularization to overcome data imbalances and model overfitting.
